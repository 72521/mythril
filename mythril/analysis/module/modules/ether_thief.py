DESCRIPTION = """

Search for cases where Ether can be withdrawn to a user-specified address.

An issue is reported if:

- The transaction sender does not match contract creator;
- The sender address can be chosen arbitrarily;
- The receiver address is identical to the sender address;
- The sender can withdraw *more* than the total amount they sent over all transactions.
